## Description
This is a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-weather-app) from The Odin Project's Javascript course. A vanilla JS app that fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays a forecast to the user.

## Technical notes:
- The app bundles with Webpack.
- The app uses the Fetch API to make requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

## ToDo list:
- Handle errors for unrecognised area input.
- Integrate geolocation API to get users location.
